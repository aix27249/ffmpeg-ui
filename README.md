ffmpeg-ui
=========

Cross-platform FFMpeg GUI frontend based on Qt

Idea
----
Sometimes, people need to convert video and audio. Usually, I use ffmpeg from command line, but I'm tired to do so, because there are LOTS of parameters. Also, there are people who simply cannot into console (they are not hackers, srly).

Most people need to convert media from random input format to some set of fixed target formats (for mp3 player, car, etc). So my idea is to write a very simple UI with presets for each case. Some basic presets will be supplied by default, and users can create their own presets.
